# Politecnico di Milano - Time series forecasting challenge for Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning course

This is the model used in the [Time series forecasting challenge](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/16514#learn_the_details
) as part of the "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course at Politecnico di Milano in 2023/24.
The goal of this challenge was to design and implement a time series forecasting model able to learn how to exploit past observations in
the input sequences to correctly predict future samples.

This model allowed us to achieve an MSE of 0.0087, securing the 31st position out of 563 in the final ranking
 ([Results](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/16514#results)).
